# Factor Analysis with a Framework for Predicting Musical Residual Seats Using Machine Learning

### Abstract
The popularity of musical actors and ticket sales are closely related. However, owing to the increase in production costs caused by star casting, a vicious cycle of ticket price increases and decreased accessibility to musicals continues. To prevent this, we identify the major factors affecting ticket sales and propose a factor analysis method via a machine learning-based musical remaining seat prediction framework. The proposed framework analyzes the factors that have a significant impact on the prediction of remaining musical seats. To verify this, we conducted an experiment using nine machine learning models along with statistical analytical techniques. We analyzed the prediction results of the models using Shapley Additive exPlanations for factor analysis. The Gradient Boosting Regressor model showed the best prediction performance. We confirmed that the discount rate was the most important factor in ticket sales. Through the proposed framework, we efficiently predicted remaining seats and confirmed the most important factors in predicting remaining seats.
